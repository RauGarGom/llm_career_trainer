What Are the Di\\x00erent Layers on CNN?\\n\\nThere are four layers in CNN:\\n\\n1. Convolutional Layer – the layer that performs a convolutional operation, creating several smaller picture windows to go\\n\\nover the data.\\n\\n2. ReLU Layer – it brings non-linearity to the network and converts all the negative pixels to zero. The output is a recti\\x00ed\\n\\nfeature map.\\n\\n3. Pooling Layer – pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of the feature map.\\n\\n4. Fully Connected Layer – this layer recognizes and classi\\x00es the objects in the image.\\n\\nQ81. What Is Pooling on CNN, and How Does It Work?\\n\\nPooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a CNN. It performs down-sampling operations to reduce the dimensionality\\n\\nand creates a pooled feature map by sliding a \\x00lter matrix over the input matrix.\\n\\nQ82.
